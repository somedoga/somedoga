- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @somedoga
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Frontend devolopment

I'm focused on React Devolopment and right now I am learning advanced javascript patterns.
My goal is create a Github page that will contain every aspect of frontend devolopment.

My future goal is learning backend as well, but for now (and probably will be for 5-10 years or some) I want to consume every drop of Javascript knowledge that I can.
